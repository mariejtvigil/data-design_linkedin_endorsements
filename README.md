## Microsoft Word
Pasting text from Microsoft Word is a sign of the apocalypse! :imp: I fixed this by making the following transformations:
- &amp; &rarr; &amp;amp;
- &rsquo; &rarr; &amp;rsquo;
- &ldquo; &rarr; &amp;ldquo;
- &rdquo; &rarr; &amp;rdquo;

The preceding are [HTML Character Entities](http://www.w3.org/html/wg/drafts/html/master/syntax.html#named-character-references) and are the proper way of inserting special characters in the web world.

In future, please don't paste from Microsoft Word.

## Personas
I don't see any personas here. Give me a persona or two, which is a profile of the typical user of LinkedIn. What are their goals? Why are they using site? What is their technology level?

## Use Cases
Exemplary! These are very detailed, thorough, and easy-to-follow. Wow!
