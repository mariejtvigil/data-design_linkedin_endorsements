		<h1>Background Information for LinkedIn Endorsement</h1>

		<!--???-->
		<div class="flexItem1">
			<h3>Summary of Skill Endorsements</h3>
				<p><strong>Skill endorsements</strong> are a great way to recognize your 1st-degree connections' skills with one click. They also let your connections validate the strengths found on your own profile. Skill endorsements are a simple and effective way of building your professional brand and engaging your network.</p>
				<p><strong>Receiving endorsements:</strong> Scroll down to the Skills & Endorsements section on your own profile to see endorsements you've received. You can add any skill to this section. Accumulating a high number of endorsements for a skill adds credibility to your profile, and shows that your professional network recognizes you have that skill.</p>
				<p><strong>Giving endorsements:</strong> Endorsing others is a great way to recognize your colleagues for the skills you’ve seen them demonstrate. It helps contribute to the strength of their profile, and increases the likelihood they’ll be discovered for opportunities related to the skills their connections know they possess.</p>
				<p>Endorsing your colleagues also helps keep strong connections with the people in your network. You may find that after endorsing a colleague from the past, it’s easier to reach out to them because you’ve recently been in touch.</p>

			<h3>A LinkedIn User can endorse Connections in the following ways</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Connection endorsements are based on the 50 skills that an individual puts into their profile. A Plus Symbol (+) for YES Endorse and an X for Do Not Endorse. Endorsement is usually based on the type of professional experience you had with Connection—if you didn’t have a certain experience with that Connection than don’t endorse that skill.</li>
					<li>LinkedIn solicits Endorsements for you at the top of your LinkedIn Connections’ Home Page. </li>
					<li>You can also click on Connection’s photo and LinkedIn will encourage you to endorse your Connection when LinkedIn loads Connection’s Home Page.</li>
				</ul>
		-->

		<!--???-->
		<div class="flexItem1">
			<h3>Endorsements verses Recommendations</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Endorsements are <strong>less time consuming</strong> than Recommendation letters (Endorsements—seconds/minutes; Recommendations—half hour/hour)</li>
					<li>Endorsements are <strong>easy and simple</strong> compared to Recommendation letters (LinkedIn solicits Endorsements for you at the top of your LinkedIn Connections’ Home Page. You can also click on Connection’s photo and LinkedIn will encourage you to endorse your Connection when LinkedIn loads Connection’s Home Page)</li>
					<li>LinkedIn Connections feel <strong>safer giving endorsement</strong> than Recommendation letters (Connections endorse you based on the 50 skills that an individual puts into their profile. Recommendations are the old fashion referral letter—where a person has to provide creditable facts.)</li>
					<li>You can <strong>delete or refuse an endorsement</strong> if you disagree with endorsement.  LinkedIn will email a notification to you that you have received an endorsement or you can view notification within your LinkedIn Home Page. Recommendations are usually solicited by you by starting a “request recommendation” letter to a Connection.</li>
				</ul>

			<h3>Public Relations & Marketing reasons for LinkedIn Endorsements—<small>Overall, it's a thumb's up!</small></h3>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>You pick the skills you want to be endorsed.</strong> (You can also change the order that these appear on your profile. You have the right to approve an endorsed skill that a Connection created as well as you can hide the endorsements you don’t want to display.)
					</li>
					<li><strong>There are three ways you can make endorsements work for you:</strong></li>
						<ul>
							<li><strong>Higher Searchability/more visibility:</strong> Users can be found in LinkedIn by conducting a keyword search for skills.</li>
							<li><strong>Higher Profile Ranking:</strong> LinkedIn works similarly to Google – the more a keyword is featured within your profile, the higher the ranking. When a recruiter is using LinkedIn and conducting a keyword search, the more endorsements you have received for a particular skill, increasing your chances of being found.</li>
							<li><strong>Good Public Relations (PR):</strong> Consider if you are applying for a job, for instance, and your competitor has 99+ endorsements from colleagues and previous supervisors, while you have zero, that could hurt your chances for the job and diminish your personal brand.</li>
						</ul>
				</ul>

			<h3>How to make those endorsements that you receive from others work best for you:</h3>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Control Who’s Endorsement You Show</strong>—Why would you want to limit the visibility of any precious Endorsements that you might have received?</li>
						<ul>
							<li>you want the faces on your Endorsement to be the most “influential” people that your target audience for your profile would immediately recognize</li>
							<li>there are some who you might not want their face to be part of your profile</li>
						</ul>
					<li><strong>Choose Your Skills to Align with Your Personal Brand</strong>—deleting out those Skills that you don’t feel best represent you</li>
					<li><strong>Take Endorsement Choices as Invaluable Feedback</strong>—use this information about your brand as invaluable feedback coming from your trusted network</li>
					<li><strong>Deepen Your Relationships by Thanking Those Who Endorse You</strong>—reach out to those who endorsed you and thank them (asking them: “What can I do to be of help to you?”)</li>
				</ul>
		</div>


		<!--???-->
		<div class="flexItem1">
			<h3>Why would you want to endorse others in your network?:</h3>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Endorse Your Connections for Engagement</strong>—sending your Connection a pat-on-the back or high-five without sending a personal message
					</li>
					<li><strong>Help Your Connections with Their Personal Branding</strong>—your endorsing your network for the skills that would make the strongest contribution to their professional branding.</li>
					<li><strong>Leave Your Footprint on Your Network’s Profile</strong>—if there is someone in your network that you want your own personal brand to be aligned with and well also lead people to your profile page by being seen on a Connection’s page</li>
					<li><strong>Pay It Forward</strong>—help others in your network before they ask for it (You never know how an endorsement might help them in the future—it definitely cannot hurt)</li>
				</ul>
				<p><strong>Note:</strong> The endorsement function does not replace the good-old-fashion referral/recommendation letter, but rather, can be a compliment to your profile and ultimately help you get found. (Although, if you ask a recruiter about endorsements, they don’t give them much weight (much more weight is put on recommendations) but they do say that they are “nice to have.”)</p>
